That day became special—not just because of the laughs, but because it was when we started talking and discovered our shared love for art, sketching, and so many other hobbies. That day, I didn't just gain a friend I found a sister. 🫂❤"

It was the start of our journey, where we got to know each other really well and formed a super strong bond. This trip will always be a cherished memory for me, because we spent a whole week together, taking care of each other. I was so happy to be with you during that week. If it hadn’t been for you, I’m sure I would have caused some trouble or the other, leading to complications. You’ve always been there for me, no matter where you are. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude on your special day. Happy birthday, Paragi didi!"
